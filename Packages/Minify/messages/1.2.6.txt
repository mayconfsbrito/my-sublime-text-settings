Version 1.2.6
-------------

* New feature: Added uglifyjs_options to the settings file
    (Thanks to paponius for the suggestion)
* Update: Updated the installation instructions because from now on we must install clean-css-cli instead of clean-css
    (Thanks to Claude Betancourt for the headsup)


# SUGGESTION: #

Please open up a shell window (`Terminal` on Mac OS X, `CMD window` on Windows) and issue the following command:

    npm install -g clean-css-cli uglifycss js-beautify html-minifier uglify-js minjson svgo

followed by:

    npm update -g clean-css-cli uglifycss js-beautify html-minifier uglify-js minjson svgo
